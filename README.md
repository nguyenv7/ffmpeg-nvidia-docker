# Accknowledgement 
Usage the `patch` from `https://github.com/keylase/nvidia-patch`

[NVENC patch](patch.sh) removes restriction on maximum number of simultaneous NVENC video encoding sessions imposed by Nvidia to consumer-grade GPUs.

[NvFBC patch](patch-fbc.sh) allows to use NvFBC on consumer-grade GPUs. It should be applied same way as NVENC `patch.sh`, except you have to use `patch-fbc.sh` instead.

Main target operating system is **GNU/Linux**, but for **Windows** support see [**win** (clickable)](win).
